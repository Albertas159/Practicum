# MCM PRACTICUM - The Blurble System

## Introduction

We investigate the effectivness of summerization models (BART,BERT,PEGUSUS and T5) with novels. This input source is drastically longer than previous litterature where they use datasets based on news articles. 
We create our own test datasets, by data mining/extracting information from Project Gutenberg, Wikipedia, and Goodreads.

## Instructions

Most of the code for this project has been done in Google Colab and can now be found in /src/. 
- Dataset_Genesis.ipynb Has all the code for creating the main datasets
- This Dataset is analized and trimmed in Data_Analysis.ipynb
- Various models are prepared and run on the dataset in the "Models and Results" folder
- Other files are self-explinatory and were made to better analyse and understand our results
